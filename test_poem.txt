Whispering Winds
In the whispering winds of the night,
Stars above, oh, so bright.
Moonlight dances on the sea,
A gentle breeze, just you and me.

Nature sighs, a peaceful song,
In this moment, we belong.
Time stands still, hearts in tune,
Under the watchful gaze of the moon.

A Moment in Time
In the golden glow of the setting sun, dreams take flight, and shadows run; whispers of twilight brush the sky, as day bids farewell with a sigh.
